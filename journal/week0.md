![MFA](/journal/Img/week0/MFA.png)
#### Create an administrative user and Enable AWS multi-factor authentication
- Create an admin user to minimize root user access to your account [Following Amazon best practices for securing my AWS account and its resources](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/security-best-practices/)
- Attach the administratoraccess policy to the admin user we just created.

#### Recreate Logical Architectual Diagram in Lucid Charts
- [The Lucid Charts Link to The Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/1a6c5bc1-dda4-46a9-9b86-701cabf15d58/edit?viewport_loc=-108%2C216%2C2208%2C1004%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_4097ab4a-18ea-454a-b1cf-c127b8afb91e)
- Used two availability zones for improving the availability and resilience of the applications and infrastructure.
- Created public subnet and private subnet for securing the database and the backend and isolate them from the internet and other publicly accessible networks,This can help reduce the risk of attacks and unauthorized access.

#### Use CloudShell
![CloudShell](/journal/Img/week0/cloudshell.png)
#### Generate AWS Credentials
![AWS Credentials](/journal/Img/week0/Credentials.png)

#### Installed AWS CLI
- I am using arch linux so I installed aws-cli from [the documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) with this command
```shell
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"; \
unzip awscliv2.zip; \
sudo ./aws/install
```
- Enable [autocompletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-completion.html) in Zsh
```shell
autoload bashcompinit && bashcompinit
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```
- To Confirm the installation run

#### Destroy your root account credentials Set MFA IAM role
- I already did that.

#### Use EventBridge to hookup Health Dashboard to SNS and send notification when there is a service health issue.
 <!-- TODO: -->
#### Review all the questions of each pillars in the Well Architected Tool
- Done, I was going to write summary of the 47 questions but I think this will be so much to cover in here.

#### Create an architectural diagram the CI-CD logical pipeline in Lucid Charts
- [The Lucid Charts Link to The Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/1a6c5bc1-dda4-46a9-9b86-701cabf15d58/edit?viewport_loc=-108%2C216%2C2208%2C1004%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_4097ab4a-18ea-454a-b1cf-c127b8afb91e)

#### Research the technical and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the technical path for technical flexibility.
- Ec2 limits [From the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) is depending on the region so for example the N.Virginia region you can only attach 8 Security groups to a running instances, this is an example of technical limitation.
- By default, you can not create more than 20 instances per region, Amazon provides a safety feature in which by default you can not create more than 20 instances in a region. If you have a requirement to create more than 20 instances per region, you need to submit a limit increase request before launching your resources.
- Also, there are limits on each resource type.
- It is a good Security practice to limit your instance count as low as possible to prevent malicious actors from creating a ton of instances in your AWS account.
